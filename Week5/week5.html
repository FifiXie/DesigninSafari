			<p> <b>Refined Proposal one Burmese Python’s Enrichment </b></p>
			<br>

			<p>Based on the feedback and continuous research on the Burmese python, here is my new improved proposal on Burmese Python’s Enrichment.</p>

				<br>
<p>This Enrichment is targeted on provoke python’s behavior on catching a prey. This method is not limited to Burmese Python only, most pythons and boas should be able to be benefited from this proposal. In general, both Python and Boa families are “Ambush Hunters”, which means they kill their preys by constriction. However, in most settings where pythons and boas are being fostered by humans, it is unlikely they will be fed with live prey. In most cases, they will be fed with thawed frozen chickens or mice (depends on their sizes, sometimes the keeper will provide rabbits too). In some of python farms, to reduce cost on feeding, many farmers would make their own “fodder” that’s a mixture of different type of meat and vitamin mixtures. Unfortunately, some of those farms also would force feed their newborn and young snakes, to make sure they will easily accept dead prey and other food sources in their future farming process. Thus, make the feed process easier and the snake grew faster and larger, to sell them for profit (mostly for the snakes’ skins, and sometimes as medicine, usually in South Asia). On some the online pet forums, there are users discussing whether live feeding is applicable for their pet snakes. It seems feeding them with frozen preys are still the most common choice. There are groups of people are practicing on live feeding for their pets, mostly due to the fact that their pets have been refusing to eat dead prey. However, in the Journal <i>Herpetologica</i>, Carl E. Kauffeld, retired director of the Staten Island Zoological Society had written, most snakes prefer fresh killed prey and will eat other dead food (Kauffeld 129- 131). </p>

<br>
<p>
In my previous proposal, I mentioned the possibility providing live birds as one of the food sources for the pythons to exercise on their hunting skill. The idea behind this is motivated by the certain special traits pythons and boas have that are different then other snake families. First of all, their size. Pythons and Boas are some of the largest snake families, for any zoo, farm or individual to provide adequate spaces is challenging, often they do not get enough space for them to roam around freely. Secondly, pythons and boas move very slowly, with their extremely long body and their less active nature (in comparison with other animals that are considered active, such as monkey, dogs, etc.,), it is hardly to provoke and promote behavior by just building toys based on their curiosity. Lastly, unlike other snakes, pythons and boas are constrictors, they kill their prey by wrapping them so tight that the prey eventually stops breathing. We can foresee the possibility of the pythons not being able to exercise that wrapping behavior, if they are fed on dead preys solely. </p>

<br>
<p>
However, feeding live prey to predators does raise an ethical concern. The Environment and Animal Ethics Group (EAEG) had also published an article on Chinese Zoos conducting live feeding activities. They observed two types of live feeding happening in Chinese zoos: Type one, where visitors buy small preys to feed to the predators, and type two, “animal combats”, where predators and preys are put together in a close space. They critiqued that type one is mainly used towards profit and type two is extremely violent. In addition, having both predators and prey in such limited space does not align with their claim to help the predators regain their prey abilities.  Furthermore, Dr. Martha Keller, also raised similar ethical concern in her article, <i>Feeding live invertebrate prey in zoos and aquaria: Are there welfare concerns</i>, mentioned that feeding live food is generally considered as a good method of enrichment, and many zoo facilities do implement that methods especially with live invertebrates. However, there exist a conflict that the invertebrates’ welfare is only being considered when they are part of a collection but not when they are used as food. Furthermore, she explained in depth how invertebrates can feel physical pain and suggested that it’s possible for them to have emotional state that related to its physical pain. </p>
<br>

<p>
The conflict we are facing is a complicated one: Sure, living feeding might be an effective form of enrichment for the predators, and help them exercise or regain their hunting skills. However, we face the dilemma whether it is harming the prey’s welfare. On contrary, is it any better if we are purchasing animals that are farmed and slaughtered by human, then feed them to the predators? There use to be horse slaughter houses providing meat for zoos like “…Seattle’s Woodland Park Zoo and Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium in Tacoma, which have long fed horse meat to carnivorous animals” (Haynes). In addition, if the predators are in their natural habitat, would we consider stop them from hunting their prey to save the prey, or sacrifice the prey for the predators’ sake? Furthermore, in terms on considering the welfare of a prey, we are not treating all the animals equally when it comes to invertebrates. </p>
<br>

<p>
Therefore, for my refined proposal I wanted to still provoke and help pythons to exercise their hunting abilities. For my device I aim to incorporate a vibration buzzer that mimic a prey’s heartbeat with a pressure sensor. Once the pressure gets to certain threshold, the vibration will stop, as an indication of a prey is dead. In addition, the food source will be attached to this device, so it will not confuse the pythons or misguide them to consume non-edible props. Idealy, their pythons' chemical receptors will be able to help them to find the prop and distinguish what's the edible part.

<p><b>Future Iteration</b></p>

	<p>There are couple concerns and issues I want to address. First of all, the materiality of this prototype. This is made out of fleece, however, I would like for it to be made in materials that are little more sturdy and would last longer. In addition, it must be non-toxic nor harmful to the animals, in case they accidentally consume parts of the toy. In addition, attaching pieces of food to this prototype is to still encourge the behavior of pythos coil they prey to death then consume them. Therefore it's important to connecting the hunting action and the eating action together for this prototype to make sense. However, in the wildlife, pythons consume their preys in whole, so this prototype might alter thier behavior in a way that they will have to pick what's the edible part for them. In addition, it is relying on the python's own ability and thier chemical receptors to differentiate what's edible for them. This also might lead to them accidentally consuming certain parts of the prototypes and leads to potential harm. Lastly, on the overall apperance of the prototype. It is meant to be somewhat humoros, since it resemble cooked meat in human culture. However it does not really relate to how pythons percieve food, so at its current stage, its apprence does not really relate or serve its intended purposes for its targeted consumer (pythons and boas) </p>
