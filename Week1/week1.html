			<p>To be honest, I’ve never really spent much time on how we as human collective, or worse, even I as an individual act in a purely anthropomorphism when in contact with animals. There are countless times I try to communicate with animals with the languages I speak. Even more so, if the animals were domesticated (pets mostly), I would switch languages I use to talk to them based on their owner’s native language. As if, they would understand what I was saying at the time, or if the language they speak are dictated by their owners. In other situations, such as being in the zoo, there are times when I observe certain actions being done by an animal or a group of animals, I would announce my own interpretation to my parents. As I understood fully what they were doing and know the reasons why they were doing it. Later on, when I’m older and have younger relatives, I would pretend to be this “mature elder” figure and try to explain what is going on the zoo by interpreted their actions in the most “human” way possible. Phrases such as “They are playing with each other”, “Look he is trying to help his friend”, or “They are busy working today, so they went inside to take a nap” are often spoken. </p>

			As far as professional work goes, personally I do not have many experiences working with or for animals. However, if projecting our human thoughts on to animals is a worry, there are many occasions that I often would derive ideas or at least pretend if I were the target costumer, then image what would I want or need in certain scenario as the baseline.

			However, as de Waal mentioned in his article, not all anthropomorphism is harmful, in some cases, it can help us derive testable hypothesis and from there to gain understandings of animals we didn’t have before. The important thing to note, in my opinion, is forming testable hypothesis. That first of all, we have to acknowledge that is it only a hypothesis, even if it might be true to us or feel real to humans. Whatever we are assuming isn’t a confirmed fact on other animals yet, until it’s proven true. Secondly, testability. If we come up with some sort of hypothesis that fits in our society which isn’t at all applicable. It will not be useful in term of helping us learn more about animal, rather than coming up with more and more assumptions about them that aren’t relevant to their lives.

			All in all, this article has definitely made me more aware of how I interact with animals, and how easy it was to project myself or part of my cultural, social norms onto their lives. It almost feels like in our (at least my own) interactions with animals, there is underlaying ego-centrical and superior way of them about them. In the future, when in terms with interacting with animals, I would always remain humble and try to not project my thoughts on to them. Another thing I find interesting, relating back to de Waal’s writing that when we look at imaginable exploration areas we remove not only the overly simplified version but also the high demanding version due to our lack of knowledge. This is very realistic, however that makes me think about all those times when I was making up stories about animals’ behaviors to my young relatives: if I had a better knowledge of it, would I be able to tell them the “truth”? Does those explanation comes from my lack of knowledge, my assumption of their abilities to understand or both? Often in zoos, there are many high-level explanations either, rather, there are as simple as they can be. What if we give people easy access to those knowledges? I know kids who are seven or eight years old know all to spell different types of dinosaurs that I can’t even pronounce. I would certainly not be able to “fool” them in a zoo. So what if we all had chance to have high-level knowledge, would that reduce our anthropomorphism when we interact with animals
