			<p>Earlier we proposed a system that incorpreates sound training. Idealy there will be many "logs" planted in their living space, and each of them will have a speaker inside with a unique sound sequence. The sequences are designed based on pitches and durations, similar to the tamarins own calling system. Each log will play its sound sequence at different and random time determined by the keeper. There will also be a speaker in their living space. At training time, the speaker will play a sound sequence that matches one of the sound sequences from the "logs". The goal is for the Tamarins to find the matching log, once the sound sequence is played, the doors of the log with the match squece will open, and the tamarins will be able to dig through the doors for treats. Once they leave the log, its doors will shut closes </p>

			<p> <b>Exterior of the "Log" Design</b></p>
			<br>
			<p>The exteriorof the log is purposely designed to look like a log that would fits in the tamarins natural habtat. </p>
