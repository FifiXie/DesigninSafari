			<p>Earlier we proposed a system that incorpreates sound training. Idealy there will be many "logs" planted in their living space, and each of them will have a speaker inside with a unique sound sequence. The sequences are designed based on pitches and durations, similar to the tamarins own calling system. Each log will play its sound sequence at different and random time determined by the keeper. There will also be a speaker in their living space. At training time, the speaker will play a sound sequence that matches one of the sound sequences from the "logs". The goal is for the Tamarins to find the matching log, once the sound sequence is played, the doors of the log with the match squece will open, and the tamarins will be able to dig through the doors for treats. Once they leave the log, its doors will shut close. </p>

			<p> <b>Exterior of the "Log" Design</b></p>
			<br>
			<p>The exterior of the "log" is purposely designed to look like a tree branch that would fits in the tamarins natural habtat, and they would feel comfortable around it as well as digging for food from it. </p>

			<p>When its doors opens up, it will reseumble how the tamarins finds their food: sometimes inside of the trees through treeholes. We will plant soils and insects inside for them. In addition, learned from the Zoo expert at the Central Park Zoo, we also plan to keep some of thier favoritre food inside to reward them as treats. For correctly recognizing and remembering the sound pattern as well as, identifying the matching log. </p>

			<p><b>Things to Consider:</b></p>
			<br>
			<p>According to our research, it has been shown with high confidence that Cotton-Top Tamarins are highly capable of recognizing sound patterns, and have predictive natural language logic. Therefore, we have high hopes that our device can help them exercise their highly intelligent brains, as well as preserve thier natural hunting activities while they are in captive. In addition, we do realize that our device needs further experiments and testing, as well as training with the Tamarins for it to work successfully. We hope our proposal does not only help the animals practice thier daily physical activities but also help them utalize thier intelligence.</p>
