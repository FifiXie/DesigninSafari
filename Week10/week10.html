			<p class="title"> <b>Final Proposal One: Bonobo's Facial Recognition </b></p>
			<br>
			<img id="cotton" src="images/bonobo.jpg">
			<br>
			<br>
			<p><b>Backgroudn and Reaserch</b></p>
			<p>The Bonobo is an endangered great ape. They are identified with thier long legs, pink lips, dark face and tufted tail. They also have very distingushiable parted hair on thei head. The bonbos inhabits in the forests in Congo Basin.</p>
			<p>Bonobos are both terresterial and arboreal, which means they move and live on both land and trees. In the wild, there hasn't been many observation on bipedal walking (walking like human!), which is a figured decreased due to habituation. On the other hand, while in capitivity, there seems to be an increasing occurance on bipedal walking when adequate amount of food is provided </p>
			<p>Scientis has saided that the bonobs are capble of altriuris, compassion and empathy. The bonobo society is what scientist call it a "gynecocracy", where females holds the most power, social prevelige and resources. However, I currently have trouble to see the difference between this and the traditional matriarchy structure.The bonobos are very social and their party can be as large as 100 members. Which wioll usually devided into small groups through out the day to hunt for food.</p>
			<p>Bonobs are capble of passing the mirror test, a rough test to see that if an animal is able to self-recognize visually. Research has also shown that they are, similar to humans have attentional bias towards emotional expression than neutral expression. In addition, the Bonobos also communocate through facial expression. In on study, the scientists looked specifically into how facial communication is used during bonobos&apos; play session, "play faces are context specific and transmit an unequivocal positive message that cannot be misconceived" </p>

			<p><b>Initial Concept: Slot Machine</b></p>
			<p>Based on the Bonob&apos; facial recognition ability, build a Sloth machine with different types of facial expressions. If they can successfully matching different types of expression they will get rewarded with food. This initial idea is only targeting to excercise their facial expression recognition ability. However there will be more research on their social behavoir and how facial expression is used in different social activities to further this project. Idealy, I would love for this project to be able to provoke some of thier physical activites as well. Especially, their behvaior changes while in capativity as well as in the wild due to habituation. </p>

			<p class="title"> <b>Final Proposal Two: Bonobo's Feeding </b></p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Background and Research</b></p>
			<p>In terms of mating, Bonobos do not form permanet monogamous sexual relationship, and the promoscouous mating natural the male ususally cannot identify their offspring, thus the parental care is usually depended on the female. The interesting find here is that according to researches that Bonobos as very prosocial and gentle group of chimpanzee, they volumtarily share food with others. However, when come to feeding, the female bonobos would prefer to feed alone if possible</p>

			<br>
			<p><b>Initial Concept: "Feeding Room"</b></p>
			<p>A designated but open area for the female to go and feed thier infants if they prefer. From my understading, the research liste above is in a very controled enviorment, even though the designs if aim to serve for the bonobs in capativities. I believe that the bonobos still lives in a group setting. In addition, wehther in the wild or capativity, there is no researches or observation mention that the females will leave the group in any condition. Thus, I wanted to adress their preferences, but also not alter any their natural behaviour. Therefore I proposal having a small open space that's is filled with food and some indication of half-open boundry in thier living space for the females to go feeding if they chose to. Based on the social heirchy, and the male limiation to food resources, I believe the female will gain control of the food in the open area, and they can choose whether to feed there or not.</p>

			<p class="title"> <b>Final Proposal Three: Bonobo's Sociosexual Behaviour </b></p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Background and Research</b></p>
			<p>The bonobos have a series of fascinating sociosexual behaviours. To start with, unlike other animals, sexual acttivies are not solely serving for reproductive purpose. Instead, they are means to form social bonds, or resolves conflict or act as postconlifct reconciliation. They are so far, the only non-human animal to have been observed with tongue kissing. In addition, they alsoe enage in ventro‚Äêventral position, meaning fact-to-face interourse.</p>
			<p>Moreover, the the bonobos also engage in same sex sexual behaviours such as genital rubbing in both  male-male and female-female settings. Mothers will sometimes help their sons get more matings from other females. Adult males bonobs sometimes will have sex with infants.</p>
			<p>Reaserches also have shown that sex can be used as tension regulation as well. One study in perticular show that during short term corwding and feeding, the non-reproductive sexual interaction has intensified where as copulayion did not.</p>
			<p>I found this aspect of their behaviour extremely interesting. Especially there are certain behaviour that does not align with our social standards. However, it is how the bonobs live. There is one <a target="blank" href="https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.newschool.edu/doi/full/10.1002/zoo.21310">survey</a> on the bonobs&apos; oral contraceptive pill usage in North America Zoos. Among the seven participating insitution, most common reported pur[pose are: pregnancy prevention (51.7%), space constraints (24.1%), medical reason (10.3%), other (10.3%), and because the female lacks maternal skills (3.4%). Which I found extremely interesting that space constraints and lacking of maternal skills are one of the top reasons. </p>

			<p><b>Initial Concept: "What do we do"</b></p>
			<p>This is more of a refelction than a proposal on the enrichment of bonobs. After research and research, which I really enjoyed doing, especially learning abou the experiments thats being conducted. I realized that most of them are in a very controled enviroment, which is really good for getting percise results and therefore help us getting conclusions and learning about animals. However, in bonobs case in particular, I noticed because of their, to us, and in comparison to other animals, extremely unsual behaviour, it spiked our interests. I am glad throught out my reaserch I have not encoutered any commetary on thier particular behaviours. However, ethologist Frans de Waal, did say, "A lot of the things we see, like pedophilia and homosexuality, may be leftovers that some now consider unacceptable in our particular society." This has promote me to think that as humans, with resources and "power" we have, I do feel that we should be responsible to help other species flourish or rebuild their lives that we took away from them. However, part of me wonder that do we get the right to judge them and put them in the way we believe is best for them? If someone who is more informed, or in a way "better understanding" for what is best for others, do they get to decide for others? Even if we are more capable to predict a consequenses for foresee any possible undesired outcome, do we have the right to decide whether if a female bonob should not reproduce because our knowledg on her lacking of maternal skills?</p>
