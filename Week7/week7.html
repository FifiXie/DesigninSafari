			<p class="title"> <b>Midterm Proposal: Designing for the Cotton-Top Tamarins </b></p>
			<br>
			<img id="cotton" src="images/cv1.jpg">
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>During my visit at the Central Park Zoo, I decided to observe the Cotton-top Tamarin. The Cotton-Top Tamarins are small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_monkey"> <i>New World Monkey</i></a> that weigh less than 0.5kg. The Cotton-Top Tamarin are currently classified as "critically endangered" by the IUCN. The Cotton-Top Tamarins have a very clear dominance hierarchy: only the dominant pairs breed. They also displays a high level of cooperative care, as well as altruistic and spiteful behaviours. In addition, studies show that there exists grammatical structure in terms of their communication.

			<p>During my observation, I noticed the tamarins uses their hands, feet and mouth very often. I'm assuming their tails are used for balance purposes, however it is hard to confirm from this observation solely. Below is the Homoculus Diagram I created based on this specific observation.</p>

			<p class="title"> <b>Part II: Local Pet Store, Animal Shelter and Hospital visit </b></p>
			<br>

			<p> <b>Observations</b></p>
			
			<p>During this observation my partner Yating and I visted a pet store: Petco, two animal shelter:Animal Haven and Best Friends Pet Adoption Center, and one animal hospital :Tribeca Soho Animal Hospital.</p>

			<p>At the pet store we found many items that are very anthropomorphic. Such as the rainboots, the dress, and the fake neon fish. More importantly those items are designed for human needs instead of the animals'. It's obvious that dogs do not wear rainboots in thier nature habitat, the main reason why it is invented is for the ease of the dog owners. Having had clean the floor and carpets after taking dogs out on a walk during a damp or snowy day, I understand the pain. However, these product didn't really take consideration of the animals' needs.</p>
			<br>
			<div class="grid">

				<img id = "item2" src="images/2.jpg">

				<img id = "item3" src="images/3.jpg">

				<img id = "item4" src="images/4.jpg">

				<img id = "item5" src="images/5.jpg">

				<img id = "item6" src="images/7.jpg">

			</div>
			<br>

			<p>However, there are some items are enriching for the animals. For example, the dripper for the lizard, the fake cactus, the rocks and plants for the fish, and the toys for the birds to play with. On the other hand, we did notice that some animals are putting into very small spaces as shown below. A lot of the small birds are put into one big cage, where as the big birds sometimes has their own cage. Similarly, Guinea pigs share a big cage and hamsters have thier own cage. These settlements are mostly decided based on animals habits and preference. Hamsters are more territorial and would fight when putting into one cage, where as guinea pigs preferr companies. Nonetheless, there are fish for sell that's packed in single containers for the convinience of their customers.</p>

			<br>
			<p>Petco also offers grooming services where people can bring their pets to the store and have the groomer help them with shaving and cleaning the pets. Petco do have an open area where the customers can watch their pets being groomed. We stooded there and watched for a while. There are leashes connected to the animals to help them stay in place. For the small dog we watched, there is a table where it stand, it matches the height to the groomer's convinience. In the room there is a water bowl for the animal, after they are done grooming. There are couple different types of shavers being used based on the area that the groomer is working on.</p>

			<br>
			<p>At the shelters, things were very different. At the Animal Haven, we didn't get to talk to any experts, the entire place is very private. Visitors don't get to see all the animal. There are one dog and two cats where visitors have access to. </p>
			<p>On the other hand, Best Friends Pet Adoption Center have most of their animal on display. The cats are kept together in two big rooms where visitors can go in and interact with them. The keepers are always there to check on them as well, we saw one cat getting injected during our vist. One of thier staff also told us, since the cats are kept in the big rooms with small cubes together, they will also rotate where they sleep so each one gets some space once a while. In addition, they also have kittens that are kept seprately from the adult cats. They do have newborns that are kept in the incubators and being fed every two hours. They also require cares and assitance when they urinate. Those babies will be kept in the incubator for approximately 6 weeks, and the volunteer will keep them at home to train them as house cats for about 2-4 weeks.</p>

			<br>
			<p>The dogs are kept in individual rooms, each room has a bed and water. On each door there is a hole where visitors can put there fingers through for the dogs to smell and get familiar with them. The staff told us, at their facility they offer all types of vaccines and all their animals are microchipped. They also have a life time return policy where they promise to take the animals back to thier shelter if the owners wish to give the pets back</p>
			<p>Lastly, we went to the Tribeca Soho Animal Hospital. We didn't not get a chance to talk to a surgeon, but the recipetionist had given us some information on how they operate. This vet only treats cats and dogs but their sister hospital does treat exotic pets. Usually if surgery is needed the surgeon will take the patient downstairs where they operate. At this location, they do not have over night care, therefore sometimes the vets will Uber the patient to other locations where they can be treated. Their system sounds very similar to human hospitals.</p>
			<br>
			
			<p> <b>Reflection</b></p>

			<p>It was an very interesting exprience to visit three different types of locations. The pet store offers lots of toys, food, appreals and services for animals. However, their main target is the pet onwers, as human, who would purchase thier products. Even though there are products as maze for hamsters, or fake logs for the lizards. The advertisement or the packaging are still only appealing to the humans. In addition, there are clothing items which are not at all necessary for the animal themselves.</p>
			<p>The shelters seems more animal friendly, where they try to provide as much care as they can for the animals. There were lots of toys laying around for them, and we saw keepers going in and out of the rooms to either clean or treat the animlas. In addition, there are specialists who take care of the newborns around the clock.</p>
			<p>Our hospital experience was limited, we did not get to see how they interact with the animals. One thing interesting I noticed is when we were speaking with the recieptionist, I kept on saying the word "animals" and she would then refer them as "patients."</p>
			<p>There are definitely things we can integrate and learn from to improve our design in the wild or urban places. Things such as the water dripper which mimic how lizards get water when they are in the wild. Or things like the fake cactus that can reflect as close to thier natural habitat as possible. Or the toys for birds which is sitimulating for the animals. </p>
			<p>One thing I found really clever is the hole on the dog room's door at the animal shelter. It allows the visitor and the animals have an intimate moment. Yet, it is not overwhelming for the dog, it gives the dog time and space to let itself get familiar with its visitors. I found it very considerate for the animal, but it also gives the human satisfying feedback with this interaction.</p>
