			<div class="Conclusion">
			<p><b>Reflection</b></p>
			<p >One thing I strugged with conducting those ethograms is naming their behavior. It is really hard for me to come up with a name of the behavior I observed without having preconceived notions, or indicating what the behaviors might have been. In addition, it is had to find descriptive words that are detached from emotions. When I was trying to descibe how the Meerkats react who there are visitors looking at them, it was hard to not add "personalities" to them with the words we have. I try to describe how they "look" through the window and stare at the visitors. However, both the words "look" and "stare" feels very personal, and attached with feelings, rather than an objective description. On top of that, without previous knowledge on what they might have been doing, created struggles for me in terms of trying not to interprate what they are doing, as well as coming up with a description </p>
			<br>
			<p > However, when it comes to different methods of conducting the ethograms, I don't feel they are particularly different. To me the limitations and inconviniences come from the operator : me. In another words, both methods gives a lot of freedom for the observers to create descriptions, yet since it's too flexible, in my experience, it makes me feel my observations are less accurate. </p>
			<br>
			<p > If I were about to redo the observation, I would want to have more knowledge of the subjects that I'm observing. However, on the other hand I feel that would also makes my observation less objective because what I know. I would tend to lean to the reasons behind the behaviors and describe them in a more explanitory way.</p>
